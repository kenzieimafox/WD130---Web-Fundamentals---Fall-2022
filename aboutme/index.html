    <h2>Kenzie Fox</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Kenzie and I'm a freshman here at BYUI. I was born in Tucson, Arizona and am the oldest of 5 children. 
        I've lived in Flagstaff, Arizona for the last 15 years but my family just moved to Prescott, Arizona this last summer. So I moved twice this summer.</p>
    <p>My major right now is in Web Design with a minor in Theatre, but I would really like to get into Film and become a film editor someday. 
        I think it would be really cool if I could work for Disney at some point in my life.</p>
    <p>I have been doing dance and ballet for 12 years and it is pretty much the only sport I've been able to stick to for a long period of time.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for my whole life and I'm grateful for that. My favorite scripture is 2 Nephi 32:3 becuase 
        it is the first scripture that I was able to memorize. It says "Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost. Wherefore they speak the words of Christ. 
        Wherefore I say unto you, feast upon the words of Christ, for the words of Christ will tell you all thing that ye should do."</p>
