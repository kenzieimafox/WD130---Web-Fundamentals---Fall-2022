      <h3>Fantasy Books</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the world of Fantasy. Here you can find some of our most popular fantasy novels with a summary of each one to see if it is the right match for you. We also provide a short bio about the author who wrote the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harry Potter Summary: Harry Potter is an average bespectacled eleven-year-old boy who has lived with the Dursley family ever since his parents died in a car crash. For some reason, the family has always mistreated him. On his eleventh birthday, a giant man named Rubeus Hagrid hands him a letter telling him that he has been accepted as a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents were actually wizards and were killed by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, a truth that had been hidden from him all these years. He then embarks for his new life as a student at Hogwarts, gathering two good friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger along the way. They soon learn that something very valuable is hidden somewhere inside the school and Lord Voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it. They must find a way to stop him.
      <p>
        JK Rowling Bio: J.K. Rowling is an author most known for the Harry Potter series of books. 
        J.K. Rowling was born Joanne Rowling in Yate, England on July 31, 1965. As a child she liked to play with her younger sister Diane, who she called Di. They would play all sorts of make believe games. Joanne would also write fantasy storied and then read them to Di to entertain her. Growing up in England, she went to school and studied hard. She did well in school, a lot like the character Hermione from her books.
        The idea for Harry Potter came to Rowling while riding on the train to London from Manchester in 1990. The train had been delayed and she came up with the idea for a story which took place in a secret school of wizardry and had a young boy wizard as the main hero. The main characters and ideas branched off from there and she was soon writing the first book.
        While writing the first book several major events took place in Rowling's life that impacted the story and characters she was writing about. First her mother died. This direct experience allowed her to transfer the deep sorrow she felt to Harry and the loss of his parents in the story. Also, she got married, moved to Portugal, and had a kid. Despite all these major changes, Rowling continued to write and finally finished the book in 1995.

      <p>
        JRR Tolkien Bio: John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (3 January 1892 to 2 September 1973) was an English writer and philologist. He was the author of the high fantasy works The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.
        From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within the same university to become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, and held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.
        After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion.
        While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused him to be popularly identified as the "father" of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy.

        The Stormlight Archive Summary: Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.
        It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.
        One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.
        Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.
        Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.

        Brandon Sanderson was born on December 19, 1975, in Lincoln, Nebraska, the eldest of four children.

        John Flanagan Bio: John Anthony Flanagan is an Australian fantasy author best known for his medieval fantasy series, Ranger's Apprentice, and its sister series, the Brotherband Chronicles.
        John Flanagan was born in Sydney, Australia on 22 May 1944. He graduated from Waverley College with plans to become a writer. As he grew up, he changed careers and got a job at an advertising agency. While working as a media researcher trainee, he wrote an offensive poem directed toward one of his senior executives. Eventually, the poem made it to the desk of one of the company's directors. Flanagan was called into the director's office where he complimented Flanagan's writing skills and offered him the job of trainee copywriter.
        He started working on what would become the Ranger's Apprentice series in the 1990s. The series originated as twenty short stories for his twelve-year-old son, Michael. Flanagan wanted to encourage his son to read and hoped that he could do so by convincing Michael that the stories were children's book ideas that his father wanted to test out. Also, since Michael was on the smaller side, Flanagan wanted to encourage him by showing that not all heroes must be big and strong. In fact, several characters in Flanagan's books are based on real-life people close to him.
        His son fell in love with the series and began asking for more of the stories. In the early 2000s, John decided to make the stories into the first novel, The Ruins of Gorlan, and it was published in 2004. Eleven books comprise the main Ranger's Apprentice series. He has also written the Ranger's Apprentice: The Early Years series which explores the time before the first book, and has continued the story in the Ranger's Apprentice: The Royal Ranger series. His other series in the same world, Brotherband, was based around Flanagan's passion and love of the sea.
