                    He is the first and (as of 2022) only person to win both a Hugo Award and a Nebula Award in consecutive years, winning both awards for both his novel Ender's Game (1985) and its sequel Speaker for the Dead (1986). 
                    Card also wrote the Locus Fantasy Award-winning series The Tales of Alvin Maker (1987 to 2003). Card's works were influenced by classic literature, popular fantasy, and science fiction; he often uses tropes from genre fiction. 
                    His background as a screenwriter has helped Card make his works accessible. Card, who is a great-great-grandson of Brigham Young, was born in Richland, Washington, and grew up in Utah and California. 
                    He was a student at Brigham Young University (BYU) and he served in Brazil as a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). 
                    He earned a master's degree in English from the University of Utah in 1981 and wrote novels in science fiction, fantasy, non-fiction, and historical fiction genres in the 1980s. Card continued to write prolifically, and published over 50 novels and over 45 short stories. 
                    Card teaches English at Southern Virginia University; he has written two books on creative writing and serves as a judge in the Writers of the Future contest. He is a practicing member of LDS Church and has taught many successful writers at his "literary boot camps." 
                    Mormon fiction writers Stephenie Meyer, Brandon Sanderson, and Dave Wolverton have cited his works as a major influence.
